# MarktPlatz
MarktPlatz is an ecommerce platform where sellers can post their items and interested buyers can see listed items and contact sellers via an in-app chat functionality.

This repository can be forked and extended to include more functionality such as payment integration or a different UI built to make use of the backend.
